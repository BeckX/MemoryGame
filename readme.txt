Memory Game by Beckx


This is a short and simple Memory Game programmed for practicing 
Python and Pygame.
I am a programming beginner so the Code might be ugly and might not 
match the best practices for Python, so any advice on how to improve the code
is highly appreciated! 


Important : 

# needs Python 3.5 and Pygame to run
# motives folder must be in the same folder as Memory_Game.py
